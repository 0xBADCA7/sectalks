Steps:

* fetch unpack https://blinken.co/sectalks_lon-0x06.zip
* it contains mail and key
  * mail has header X-Cipher: aes-128-cbc showing encryption used
  * I extracted encrypted data with ruby and regular expression, but binwalk could be used as well,
    getting out1
* I used openssl to decrypt the data:
  $ openssl aes-128-cbc -d -kfile key <out1 >out2
* out2 contained a lot of base64 data, so I extracted it with ruby and regular expression to out3
* `file out3` said it's an ISO image
  * I tried to mount it, but it failed
  * instead used 7zip to unpack it
  * since size was 100k unpacked 3mb packed, I suspected there's other stuff there
    so I also played in VLC, it's a rickroll
* unpacked file contained:
  * snowden's pic with exifdata with gps coordinates in Moscow and room number in user comment
  * also hand-drawn map with plan to assault his home
