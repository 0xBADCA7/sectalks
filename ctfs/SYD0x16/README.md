#SYD0x16: Part 1:  Pyc me, glitch!
Reverse engineering

A new type of malware is infecting machines around the globe. We managed to download a sample that you can use for analysis. The sample can be downloaded below.

Crypto

As you can see the malware is decrypting itself in memory. But how does it work?

"How about we just deploy the same key on all devices, that's pretty easy." - IoT developers

#SYD0x16: Part 3: Ugh. Hard copy.
Reverse engineering

You should now have a fully decrypted version of the malware. Use your spidey sense to see what malware analyst would see.

"@player: Eat my flag. @boxie: Present it. @player: What? @boxie: Present it. Whip it out and I'll eat the flag."

#SYD0x16: Part 4: Resistance is futile.
Web

As you already know, our malware is communicating with a command & control server. You have been given permission to attack the C2 in order to gain control over it. But first you'll need access to the login page in order to complete your mission.

"Our tale begins at a C2, where the prisoners of the castle have called for heroes to come to their aid to attack the mad Dr. Junkenstein" - @strayapanda

Excellent, you should now have access to the C2 dashboard. Let's finish this.

"It's a figure of speech, Morty! It's malware! I don't respect them. Just keep hacking, Morty! You have no idea what prison is like here!" - Grandpa Rick

Hint: Are you sure you're the only bot connected to the network?
