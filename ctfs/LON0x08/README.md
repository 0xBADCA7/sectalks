This challenge was written for the 8th London Sectalk, organised on the 20th of April 2017.

There is no indication to start the challenge, you just need to look at `challenge.html`.

If you want clues, go read `clues.md`.

You can also find in the `how-to/` folder the different scripts I've used to create the challenge. (spoilers!)
