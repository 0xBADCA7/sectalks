# The third one

The sum of each pixel's RGB values adds up to an ASCII character.  The flag is hidden in column 227.  The other pixels in that column are black in order to provide a subtle hint.  All other pixels are just random ASCII characters.  Another hint can be found in the darkness of the image, indicating the pixel values are fairly low.
